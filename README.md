# Coder Notes
The Challenge has a MVP architecture.<br>
<img src="/screenshots/architecture.png"/>
<br>
It includes a contract (MainContract) with contracts to both the Presenter and the View layer(MainFragment). The Model layer is constituted of the WordModel (The word repository) and the GameState.
I got the structure from the [Android Architecture Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp) <br>


# Dependencies
It's using ButterKnife, Gson and Mockito.<br>
